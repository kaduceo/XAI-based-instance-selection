# XAI-based clustering and instance selection
---

This repository contains code and example notebooks related to the following paper :
- **How to make the most of local explanations: effective clustering based on influences**, E. Escriva et al. (*submitted at the ADBIS 2023 Conference*)

This paper present the first global method to explore influences as a new data space.

**Available Code Files:**
- Clustering Methods : Methods adapted to clusters influence explanations.
- Selection Methods : Methods developped or adapted to select representative instances.
- Metrics : Clustering metrics used during experiments.
- MMD-Critic :  Implementation of [MMD-Critic](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2016/hash/5680522b8e2bb01943234bce7bf84534-Abstract.html), based on the [one](https://github.com/BeenKim/MMD-critic) from authors. (*consider leaving a :star: on their repository to support authors releasing their code.*)
